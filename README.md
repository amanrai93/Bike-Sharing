# Bike-Sharing-Assignment

## Covid-19 impacted many businesses and bike-sharing was one of them. I help them identify and assess revenue drivers of bike-sharing post pandemic!

## Problem Statement
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- They want to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

## Project Objective:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands?
